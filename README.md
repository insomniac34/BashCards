BashCards
=========

A simple command line utility for quizzing of Spanish (or other language) verbs, conjugations and vocabulary. 

Motivation was as follows:

* 1.) Laziness. I have always hated making paper flashcards, yet have always recognized their usefulness.
* 2.) To learn  & apply basic machine learning techniques to help the program adapt to the user's performance
